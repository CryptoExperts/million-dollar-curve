  Introducing the <em>Million Dollar Curve</em>
</p>
<p>
  The <em>Million Dollar Curve</em> will be an alternative to curves P-256 and Curve 25519 to instantiate the ECDH cryptosystem, and will be produced in February 2016. This 128-bit secure elliptic curve is to be generated following the full methodology described in the technical paper and demonstrated in the <a href="{{ " #tutorial " | prepend: site.baseurl }}" title="Tutorial">tutorial</a> to generate the Three Cents Curve. In particular, by committing publicly on the (deterministic) process and the list of draws <em>before</em> they actually happen, our methodology is designed so that nobody (even us!) can put a trap in the Million Dollar Curve.
</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p>
    Our objective is for the <em>Million Dollar Curve</em> to inspire confidence to the greatest number. In that sense, we want to integrate comments we receive in the methodology before committing on the final methodology, final source code and the lottery draws we will use.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can direct any comment you have to us and we will gladly listen. <a class="btn btn-primary-outline btn-sm" data-mdc-mt="curves">Email us!</a>

<p>
  In what follows, we describe how we will generate the MDCurve201601 Curve (Million Dollar Curve of January 2016).
</p>
<p>Our methodology can easily be adapted (and reproducible by anyone) for new curves with possibly different specifications (e.g. not an Edwards curve or aiming at 256 bits of security), and of course new lottery draws.
</p>
<p>
  We will likely generate new Million Dollar Curves in the future on this website as needed.
