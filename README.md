# Million Dollar Curve

The Million Dollar Curve project aims at providing a new alternative to many standards about elliptic-curve cryptography
(ECC), including ANSSI FRP256v1, NIST P-256, NIST P-384, Curve25519, secp256k1, or brainpoolP256t1.

If you haven't already done so, we recommend that you consult the main
[website](https://cryptoexperts.github.io/million-dollar-curve/) of this project, which provides all the information you
need to get started, including a tutorial on how to use the python scripts provided here.
